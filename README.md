# Credits
This project was made possible thanks to the following projects and tools.

* template-tailwindcss-typescript - A streamlined Tailwind CSS v3.x template for Create React App in TypeScript.

* The Heroku CLI - I used a CORS proxy to avoid “No Access-Control-Allow-Origin header” problems when making an API requst from CarsXE API.

* axios - Making API requsts using get method and ".then .catch" syntax.

* Ministry of Transport and Road Safety API - A vehilce info search API with license plate number.

* Google Translate - Rapid API - translating the car manufacture in order to make a request for the car image.

* CarsXE API - Supplying this API : make, model and year gave me a way to present the most relevent image for the specific car.
